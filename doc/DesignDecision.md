## Tabbed View:

We started off with the requirement that we had to be able to display the pinned items and the recent items to the buffer. So we came up with two concepts, the first being a tabbed view and the second being a regular view with items that float to the top once they are pinned. 

We diagrammed up both of the options and created prototypes of each option and put it to test within our team. We were testing primarily on the user experience and the ability to quickly reach the specified item.

With the tabbed view we found it very easy to know which view we currently are looking through and liked the idea that we be able to store them in two separate list as most likely you would only want to use one of the list and rarely would you need to view both of the lists. Thus the tabbed view allowed for a more intuitive way to be able to search through the material.

## Color Scheme

We chose a color scheme that adhered to the online Material.io style and color guidelines. We chose black text and icons because of the correct contrast for readability.


## Material Design

Material Design was chosen because of its momemntuous impact in native Android user exerperiene. Users have come to expect a certain level of design in the apps that they use. 

Some major elements that we immediately identifed were the app bar, tab view, and overlay. All of these items features common native material design themes that users would be able to quickly grasp.

We also spent a significant time research the typography standards and ended up following the common typography standards listed on Google's Material Design Site for Web and Mobile Standards. It proved to be an excelllent resource in outlining many of our design and user experience decisions inside the app.
